    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      This page showcases a portfolio of prototype dashboards I’ve built to support institutional sustainability reporting and insights. Each dashboard is based on real-world use cases I’ve worked on at the University of Auckland, covering key areas such as energy consumption, air travel emissions, commuting patterns, and biodiversity observations.

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
      While some dashboards are still under development or use simulated data, they reflect applied logic, stakeholder-informed requirements, and practical visual design. These projects demonstrate my ability to connect complex data sources (SQL, Snowflake, APIs), apply custom business rules (e.g. utility channel filtering, biodiversity tagging), and present results clearly using web-based technologies (HTML, Tailwind, and data visualizations).
